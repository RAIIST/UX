> **Summary**
This paper presupposes that can the level of cognitive effort that a user utilizes when using an application can be split into two groups:

> 1. System 1 - Intuitive thinking and decision making
> 2. System 2 - Effort-full and analytical thinking that only intervenes at times to endorse, correct and reject decisions

> Further, they analyze whether a user can be seen to be engaged in System 2 thinking by observing changes in pupil dilation which represent the degree of effort being expended.
